For each of the following expressions:
 - Does it have a syntax error?
 - If it doesn't have a syntax error, what are the probable input and output types of the function?

a) x => x + 1

    (x) => x + 1  //would +1 x

b) x, y => x * y

    (x, y) => x * y  //multiplies x and y


c) x => { x * 2 }

    (x) => { x * 2}   // would *2 x

d) (x, z) => {console.log(z); return x * z}

correct syntax, would console.log and return x * 2

e) x => console.log(z); return x * z

        x => {console.log(z); return x * z}

f) (x) => x * 2

        correct syntax

e) () => console.log("hello")

       would probably console.log...
